# Greenfield Product Portal
This React app is a mockup of this example retail portal: https://xd.adobe.com/view/e600dc0f-454c-44e3-5075-7872d04189ff-9031/?fullscreen

It features an overview section that displays product info and images. This is alongside an image carousel, size options, quantity, and cart system.

Finally, the Greenfield Product Portal features a Ratings and Reviews section. This displays all of the information provided by the reviews for that specific product, like stars, amount recommended, as well as characteristic ratings. And in the Reviews area, displays a list of reviews, which can be sorted with a dropdown option. You may also rate Ratings, Reviews, Questions, and Answers as helpful.
